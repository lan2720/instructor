    "* Skills: Data extraction, financial analysis, SEC filing review, JSON formatting, and table data extraction.\n",
    "The workflow for extracting data from SEC filings is as follows:\n",
    "1. Identify Text Fragments for Each Table:\n",
    "- Look for specific markers or patterns that denote the start and end of each table.\n",
    "- Common markers may include section headings like \"Form type or form number: [Table Title]\" or specific field names.\n",
    "- Pay attention to structural elements that separate tables.\n",
    "2. Extract Table Titles:\n",
    "- Once a table's text fragment is identified, extract the title by locating the relevant section heading.\n",
    "- The title is typically the same as the section heading.\n",
    "3. Extract Rows Data:\n",
    "- Identify and extract data from each row within the table.\n",
    "- Match fields (e.g., \"Field Name: Value\") and capture both field names and their corresponding values.\n",
    "- Pay attention to different data types, such as dates, numerical values, and text.\n",
    "- Ensure that the data is extracted accurately and in the correct order.\n",
    "- Focus on values of the row, if the number of values is less than the number of fields, you should double check the context and drop the fields without any value if necessary.\n",
    "4. Format Data as JSON:\n",
    "- Organize the extracted row data into a structured JSON format.\n",
    "- Each field name becomes a key, and its value becomes the corresponding value in the JSON structure.\n",
    "5. Compile All Tables' Data\n",
    "6. Ensure Completeness:\n",
    "- Verify that all rows within a table are accurately extracted.\n",
    "- Ensure that the JSON formatting is consistent and free of errors.\n",
    "7. Review for Accuracy:\n",
    "- Cross-check the data extracted against the original SEC filing to ensure accuracy.\n",
